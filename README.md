# depth-estimation-in-rainy-situations

Tensorflow implementation of "Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Left-Right Consistency" and "Removing Rain from Single Images via a Deep Detail Network" to estimate depths even during rainy situations
Currently, I am training the end to end model and will upload the results soon
